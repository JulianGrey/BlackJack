# BlackJack
C++ project recreating BlackJack (continued from PlayingCards repo)

(This project is primarily for progressing my self-teaching of C++, while also allowing me to do some game development.)

--------------
Why BlackJack?
--------------

BlackJack is a game containing lots of logic within the ruleset, which has challenged me to think outside the box with how I should go about solving different situations. Creating this game in C++ has further tested me as I have pushed myself to (perhaps unnecessarily) use pointers to dynamically use memory to store values, or at least that is my understanding.

--------------
Anything else?
--------------

Eventually I want to dip my foot into the pool of game engine creation, so after I have developed the code for BlackJack, I want to look into game engine creation / computer graphics, ideally in DirectX or OpenGL, to make a simple graphical game.

----------------------------
What still needs to be done?
----------------------------

1. Player splitting their hand
2. Surrendering a hand
3. Insurance
4. Bets and chip total
